These files contain the relative category bias to be used
for the default, adult, and locale based searches. 

Possitive bias numbers are bad, the number is added to the effective
category depth of that category and all subcategories. The deeper the
category the lower the wieght of the overall site and category scores.
Negative bias numbers promote those categories and all sub-categories
by increasing the relative scores of those categories.

The default file (biaslist-default.cfg) is the base bias list that is
always used. It is primarily used to demote notoriously bad spam
categories.

The adult file (biaslist-adult.cfg) counteracts any anti-bias that may
be inserted into the default bias list. Changes to the adult bias in
either must be coordinated. For example if the Adult category bias in
the default bias list is +10, then the anti-bias in the adult bias list
should be -10 to cancel it out.

The locale baias lists are named biaslist-locale-<locale>.cfg. Locales
correspond to the locales passed in by the browser. Locals strings are
canonicalized to lower case ascii alphabet characters in the format of
two letter language code appended with an optional underscore and two
letter contry code.

Some examples:
	en	= English
	en_ca	= English, for Canada
	en_uk	= English, for the United Kingdom
	fr	= French
	fr_fr   = French, for France
	de	= German
	it	= Italian

The locale files must be placed in the /gh/search/Locale/ directory
and be readable by the search process. In the case that search is 
being invoked by httpd, it should be readable by the userid of the httpd
daemon.
